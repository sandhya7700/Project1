## Switch Statement
Q: Write a JavaScript switch statement that takes a variable areaOfShapes representing
different shapes, and based on its value, calculates and logs the area of the corresponding
shape. Consider three shapes: 'Rectangle,' 'Circle,' and 'Square.' For 'Rectangle,' use variables a
and b as the sides; for 'Circle,' use a variable r as the radius; and for 'Square,' use variable a as the
side length. If the provided shape is not recognized, log a message saying, 'Sorry the shape is not
available.' Test your switch statement with areaOfShapes set to 'Square' and sides a and b set to
5 and 10, respectively. Ensure that the correct area (25 in this case) is logged to the console

Program To check if a year is
a leap year,

Q.1 What is window ?
Q.2 What is DOM and BOM ?


NOTE1 :- So, while the DOM is focused on the content of the
         page, the BOM is focused on the browser environment.
         The window object serves as the global object that
         encompasses both the BOM and the DOM when working in
         a browser environment.


NOTE2 :- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-like representation of the HTML
         document. It provides a way to interact with the HTML document using
         JavaScript. The DOM provides multiple properties and methods to dynamically
         change the content of the HTML document using JavaScript

## DOM Properties
document
getElementById(id)
getElementsByClassName(className)
getElementsByTagName(tagName)
querySelector(selector)
querySelectorAll(selector)
innerHTML
textContent
style

## DOM Methods
createElement(tagName)
appendChild(node)
removeChild(node)
addEventListener(event, function)
removeEventListener(event, function)
setAttribute(name, value)
getAttribute(name)
parentNode / parentElement
childNodes / children
firstChild / firstElementChild
lastChild / lastElementChild
nextSibling / nextElementSibling
previousSibling / previousElementSibling
closest(selector)
forEach (Array.from)
